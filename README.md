# Student_scores

I recently completed a project analyzing student scores. I meticulously studied Math, Reading, and Writing scores, exploring how they relate through operations like addition and subtraction. I also examined factors like parents' education, lunch type, marital status, and sports participation. Notably, I uncovered how parental education affects student performance. Presenting scores as grades, my analysis offers actionable insights for enhancing learning outcomes. Feedback is welcome, as my goal is to optimize student success!
